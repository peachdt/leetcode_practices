# Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

# For example:
# Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],
#    1
#     \
#      2
#     /
#    3
# return [1,3,2].

# Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Use Morris Traversal. 
Idea is:
    Step 1: Initialize current as root
    Step 2: While current is not NULL,
    If current does not have left child
        a. Add currentâ€™s value
        b. Go to the right, i.e., current = current.right
    Else
        a. In current's left subtree, make current the right child of the rightmost node
        b. Go to this left child, i.e., current = current.left

For Example:

          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \   /
     4   5 6
First, 1 is the root, so initialize 1 as current, 1 has left child which is 2, the current's left subtree is

         2
        / \
       4   5
So in this subtree, the rightmost node is 5, then make the current(1) as the right child of 5. Set current = cuurent.left (current = 2). The tree now looks like:

         2
        / \
       4   5
            \
             1
              \
               3
              /
             6
For current 2, which has left child 4, we can continue with thesame process as we did above

        4
         \
          2
           \
            5
             \
              1
               \
                3
               /
              6
then add 4 because it has no left child, then add 2, 5, 1, 3 one by one, for node 3 which has left child 6, do the same as above. Finally, the inorder taversal is [4,2,5,1,6,3].
